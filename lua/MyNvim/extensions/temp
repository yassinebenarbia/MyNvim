--- need to deal with each extension such that it will 
--- be placed where it should be and it won't brake the system
--- if it doesn't exist for some reason
--- and every outer module, function or anything that needs it
--- to work should not be a must for MyNvim to work
--- 
--- how about making linked files ?
---
--- check if there is a deleted file and therefor delete it in the 
--- other side
